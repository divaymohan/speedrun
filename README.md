    3. API-Service on: http://localhost:8000/api/docs#/
    4. Flower on: http://localhost:5556/workers

5. Now you can start hitting the apis on api-service.

Tech Stack used in this project:
1. Python FastAPI to build apis.
2. Postgres database to store triggers and logs
3. Celery Worker to run triggered tasks
4. Celery Beat + RedBeatScheduler to schedule the tasks
5. Redis as broker
6. Flower to track the number of messages processed or failed
7. Redis Commander: To track the scheduled tasks.
8. Swagger as API docs
9. Aws Ec2 for simple hosting

Minimum required machine:
1. Ram: 4 GB
2. Hard Disk Memory: 8 GB
3. CPU: 2
4. Expected cost 30 USD for 1 month

Note:
1. Do not schedule more then 2 tasks, It can full memory, because everything is running on very minimum infra.
2. Please delete the trigger manually.

### How to use APIs:
***********
#### Schedule Tasks with interval
**Step 1:** please create a trigger with payload:
```json
{
  "name": "Sample Scheduled",
  "trigger_type": "scheduled",
  "schedule_time": "2025-02-16T10:12:23.719Z",
  "schedule_interval": 5
}
```
Note: schedule_interval will be in seconds.

**Step 2:** Get all triggers

**Step 3:** Find id for the trigger created.

**Step 4:** Hit api to start the task.

**Step 5:** Monitor the event logs by trigger id

#### API Tasks
**Step 1:** please create a trigger with payload:
```json
{
  "name": "Sample Scheduled",
  "trigger_type": "api",
  "schedule_time": "2025-02-16T10:12:23.719Z",
  "api_payload": {"name":  "divay", "email":  "divay@gmail.com"},
  "api_url": "http://localhost:8000/api/test"
}
```
Note: Please use same api given in the payload

**Step 2:** Get all triggers

**Step 3:** Find id for the trigger created.

**Step 4:** Hit api to start the task.

**Step 5:** Monitor the event logs by trigger id
